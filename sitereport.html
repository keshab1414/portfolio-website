        <h2>Reflection on My Portfolio Journey</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What I Learned:</strong> Developing this portfolio was an exciting experience. It gave me the chance to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS, especially when it came to creating a responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. I also got the opportunity to work with GitHub, which helped me become more comfortable with version control. This process was an invaluable learning opportunity and reinforced my passion for web development!</li>

            <li><strong>Why I Chose This Design:</strong> I wanted my portfolio to have a clean and modern look that felt both professional and easy to navigate. The brown and white color scheme was chosen because it’s visually appealing, and I felt it really helped convey a sense of elegance and simplicity. I aimed for a design that would be user-friendly and provide an enjoyable browsing experience while still reflecting my personal style.</li>

            <li><strong>Challenges and Debugging:</strong> There were definitely some hiccups along the way, especially when it came to making sure everything was responsive and aligned across different devices. But through careful testing and using browser developer tools, I was able to debug and fix issues as they came up. One challenge I faced was ensuring the layout was clean and didn’t look cluttered, but with a bit of patience and troubleshooting, I got it just right!</li>

            <li><strong>Validation:</strong> To make sure my site was running smoothly and properly, I validated the HTML and CSS. I tested my website on different browsers and devices to ensure it performed consistently. After fixing a few minor issues, I’m happy to say everything passed validation, and the website now functions perfectly across multiple platforms!</li>

            <li><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> I’m really excited to continue adding to my portfolio. I plan to upload more projects in the future and include a demo video to showcase my work. The website will always be a work in progress, and I can’t wait to see how it evolves as I continue to learn and grow in my career.</li>
